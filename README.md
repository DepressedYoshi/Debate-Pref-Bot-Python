# Welcome to modenized soultuion for creating prefing sheets 
This is a simple bot that scraps data from Tabroom and open wiki to generate debate scout sheet. In ints cirrent state in made for policy debate only, and it will require wifi and you to put inyou own password and user name for wiki to acess it. 


## Caution 
you should un-comment all the lines of code that has been commneted it, its is a system that doubel check to see if the inital of the team is ordered correctly, but due to my design it is functionally DDos-ing the website so if you do it for a while you will get blcoked by firewall or browser. But this isensureing evey link is valid. 

To deploy, please remember to put in your tabroom and wiki username and password.
